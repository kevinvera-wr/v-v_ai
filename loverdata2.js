'%n%n%n%n%n[2] 🥺 %n\n%nThe moral of the story is i end up never feeling enough.%n\nSo I never tell them how I truely feel about them.\nAs a result I miss out on potential relationships , and while they\nmove on with the next dude, I’m left with all these feelings with no\nwhere to go and it makes it even harder to share my feelings to\nsomeone I’m interested in.',

I hope you're happy now.\nOh, and don’t fuck it up and cheat.\nIf your not happy, just leave.\nIt’ll save her from a traumatic situation.",

"[2] 🥺%n%nMet his family too, did whatever a couple would do and shit,%nevery relationship was the same, he would be madly in love%n%nwhile I couldn't wait for it to be over.....%n%nIn hindsight all the guys I dated were stepping stones,%nand with every nut brought me closer to opening doors for my career.%n%nI made a promise to myself, that I would become successful%nand make it to the top,%n%neven if i've got to fuck my way up there."

"[3] 💦%n%n%nthe day I lost my virginity,%nIt was with my childhood best friend, we got drunk and we both%nknew what lesbian sex was but never got remotely near it.%n%nBut we both knew if we were to do it would be with someone%nwe trusted.%n%nI'll cut out the details of how it went, but it didn't look%na thing like porn, more like two sticks rubbing against each other%nand lot of pain. We surprisingly stayed friends and joke about it fromtime to time."
